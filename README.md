# rocketlauncher
Java program to run my USB rocket launcher.

I wanted to get a gifted DreamCheeky rocket launcher working on my linux machine.

I tried to design it in such a way that one can easily add a driver for a different
USB Launcher, but I do not have any others, so it may or may not be a good design!
